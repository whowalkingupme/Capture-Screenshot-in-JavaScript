# How to Take Simple Screenshot in Vanilla JavaScript



Did you know you can take or capture screenshots of any window using vanilla JavaScript? Yes, there’s no need for an external library or plugin to take a simple screenshot of the web page or window.

If you don’t know, I previously shared a blog on How to Take Screenshots using JavaScript HTML2Canvas. HTML2Canvas is a JavaScript library for taking screenshots of entire or parts of a webpage.

However, in this blog, you will learn to do the same thing (capturing screenshots) with plain JavaScript. The codes and logic behind taking a screenshot are so easy that you can easily understand them if you have some basic JavaScript knowledge.

To take a screenshot, I’ve created a dummy web page with some headings, paragraphs, and a button. When the user clicks on the button, a prompt window will be shown asking for permission to capture a screenshot. If the user accepts the permission, the webpage will be screenshotted and shown as an image lightbox.

If you’re excited to know how these actually look, you can watch the given YouTube video on How to Take Screenshots in JavaScript.

I hope you liked the demo of Taking Screenshots and understood how I created it using vanilla JavaScript. I’ve shown the screenshot as a simple image lightbox. However, it can be easily used in a feedback form or other projects.

If you don’t know, in the latest updates, YouTube does the same thing when taking screenshots in their feedback form. Earlier, they used a traditional method.

If you’ve finished watching the video and fully comprehended the codes and logic, you should be aware that by modifying some codes, you can also create a Simple Video Recorder that records the video of the user’s permitted tab.

But if you haven’t watched the video tutorial, you can continue reading the blog and follow the given steps to take screenshots. Otherwise, go to the bottom of this blog post to download the source code files.
